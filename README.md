# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview

This project sought to identify employees within Pewlett Hackard that were near retirement.  By identifying the employees nearing retirement the company could begin to plan for losses of staff.  Another component of this project was to identify senior members of the team nearing reitrement that could stay on in a mentorship role for less seasoned employees.

## Results

- During this analysis I identified over 90,000 employees that are projected to retire
- Two very valuable positions (Senior Engineer & Senior Staff) have the most retirements coming up
- The management department does not have an eligible retirees for the mentorship program
- Thre is a stark difference between the amount of of overall staff entering retirement and the amount of staff that is eligible for the mentorship program
